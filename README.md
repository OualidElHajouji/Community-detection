# SNA_CommunityDetection
After the intermediate report: 4 Fridays left.
Things left to do:
-Study of the spectrum of different Laplacian matrices
-MCMC simulations for a large set of vertices (Hard)
-Study the evolution of r_critical in terms of distribution for different Laplacian matrices
-Perform a suitable regression on the curve of Q(r)
-Optimising the Importance sampling approach for m reasonably big
-Develop an algorithm for minorities
